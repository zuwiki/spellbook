Spellbook
=========

Spellbook is an API for persistent storage of component-entity data models.

Currently, it only works for SQL databases. Eventually, we might support alternate backends.
Maybe we should even someday implement our own custom storage format optimized specifically for component-entity data, but not yet.

Component-entity is a data model where the objects of interest are entities. An entity is a collection of components. A component is a blob of data.

This architecture has been used in some prominent video games (such as Thief, Dungeon Siege, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3).

And it seemed pretty nice to us when we played around with it. But using a database to store component-entity data is a bit of a pain, since the sensible approaches don't work with ORMs easily.
